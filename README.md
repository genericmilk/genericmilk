### Oh hey whatsup 👋

My name is Peter and welcome to my GitHub! Here you can check out some of the incredible open source packages I've spent my time writing!

I am a full stack dev by trade working in Laravel, PHP, Vue, React, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3, SQL, MariaDB, Redis and ML!

I am a proud member of the LGBTQ+ family and am a passionate supporter for rights of all to love whomever they love. Happiness is the most important thing in this world and we could all do with a lot more of it! ♥️🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️

- 🔭 I’m currently working with the fine folkes at AVRillo in London helping people going through the process of moving house <3
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React! Being a bit of an officianado in Vue it's great to get an alternate take on things!
- 📫 How to reach me: You can reach out to me on Twitter super easily! It's https://twitter.com/itspeterday
