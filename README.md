### Oh hey whatsup 👋

My name is Peter and this is my Github where I work my socks off writing amazeballs code!

I am a full stack dev by trade working in Laravel, PHP, Vue, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3, SQL, MariaDB, Redis and Just recently Machine Learning!

I am Bisexual and a proud member of the LGBTQ+ family and am a passionate supporter for rights of all to love whomever they love. Happiness is the most important thing in this world and we could all do with a lot more of it! ♥️🏳️‍🌈

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a whole new platform at Quuu bridging the gap between all of the internal and public facing tools, the service has never been better and it's a great challenge to push it further every day!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Vue and Node! People are saying a lot about javascript frameworks being the future so it's great to keep up to date with them!
- 📫 How to reach me: You can reach out to me on Twitter super easily! It's https://twitter.com/itspeterday

- ⚡ Fun fact: If I didn't learn to code I'd be in Stage lighting! Good thing I started learning to code (thank you covid-19) 😅
